# Electronics-Sales-Analysis-using-Python
## ABOUT
This project is about Solving real-world data science problems with Python pandas. So involves using the Electonics Sales data set, doing some initial processing and cleaning of that data and then once we have a little bit more of a polished dataset, an exploratory data analysis is done using that data using Python pandas and Python matplotlib to extract meaning from that data. With that analysis it is possible to answer real world business type questions from the data as a data scientist or data analyst would.
